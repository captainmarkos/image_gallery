<b>* Helpful Hints *</b>
<br />
<br />
To help you understand the photo gallery and to keep your pics organized, think of the gallery as
a room filled with many collections where each collection has many albums.  Then within each album
there are many pictures.  Have a look at the <a href="../index.php?page=list_collection&gallery=2" target="_blank">goldencoconut.us photo gallery</a> to see how 
the gallery is organized.
<ul>

    <li>Each user has a Photo Gallery in which:
        <ul><li>Each gallery may have many collections.</li>
            <li>Each collection may have many albums.</li>
            <li>Each album contains many images.</li>
            <li>An album can only belong to one collection in the gallery.</li>
            <li>An image can only belong to one album in the collection.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br />

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">First - create a collection in which you want to add photo albms.</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">Next - create an album.  You upload you pics into the album for that collection to which it belongs.</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">The collection &amp; album images are going to be resized to thumbnail size (100 x 75).  So instead of uploading a huge image you will save yourself some time if you resize it before uploading.</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">Try to keep the number of images per album less than 50 (for performance and visitor experience reasons).</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">You can share the URL to your collection(s) and/or album(s) by copying the URL from your browsers address bar.  Do this from the &quot;Photo Gallery&quot; itself and not from &quot;Manage Photos&quot;.  Same is true for images. You can also paste the URLs into Facebook.</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">Uploaded images will be resized to 1200 x 900 (only if they are larger).</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">When uploading multiple images, keep the image sizes in mind.</li>
</ul>
