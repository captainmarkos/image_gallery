<b>Image Management</b> - Images must belong to an album in which that album belongs to a collection.  
Therefore when you add an image you must select to which collection and album it will belong.
When adding images, image details such as title and description are associated to the image. 

<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">To add an image:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>First choose the collection.</li>
        <li>Next choose the album to which the image(s) will belong.</li>
        <li>Finally add image details such as title and description.</li>
        <li>The image will be resized to 1200 x 900 (if needed).</li>
    </ul>

    <li style="padding: 6px 0 6px 0;">When modifying image details you change which album it belongs to.  However the collection may not be changed because to do so the album would need to be moved to that collection.</li>

    <li style="padding-bottom: 6px;">To change which collection an album belongs to, find the album details and click &quot;Modify&quot;.  From there you change the collection.</li>

</ul>
